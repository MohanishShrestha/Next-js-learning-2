# server client component
- every component in a Next.js app defaults to being a server component
- Running components on the server brings serveral advntages
    * zero-bundle size
    * direct access to server-side resources 
    * improved security
    * better SEO

limitation
- can't interact with browser APIs or handle user interactions
ie can't use hooks

# RSC rendering lifecycle
- client, Nextjs and react
- look on public file name as loading and update

Server rendering strategies
- Static rendering
- Dynamic rendering
- Streaming


#Static rendering
-It is a server rendering strategy where we generate html pages
when building our application
- think of it as preparing all your content in advance before any user visits your site
- once build these pages can be cached by cdns and served instantly to users
- with this approach the same pre-rendered page can be shared among different users giving your app a significant performance boost
- static rendering perfect for things like blog posts e-commerce product listings documentation and marketing pages

How to statically render?
- static rendering is the default strategy in the app router
- All routes are automatically prepared at build time without any additional setup


difference between server and dev server
- in production we create one optimized build and deploy it no on-the-fly changes after deployment
- A development server on the other hand focuses on the developer experience
 
Prefetching
- it is a technique that preloads routes in the background as their links become visible
- for static next js automatically prefetches and caches the whole router
- when home page loads Nextjs is already prefetching routes for instant navigation

# dynamically render
- next automatically switches to dynamic rendering for an entire route when it 
detects what we call a dynamic function or dynamic API

dynamic function 
- cookies()
-headers()
-connection()
-draftMode()
-searchParams prop
-after()


#generateStaticParams()
generateStaticParams is a function that 
- works alongside dynamic route segments
- to generate static routes during build time
- instead of on demand at request time
- giving us a nice performance boost


#dynamicParams
default true


#Streaming
-it is a strategy that allows for progressive UI rendering from the server
- Work is broken down into smaller chunks and streamed to the client as soon as they are ready
- this means users can see parts of the page right away, without waiting for everything to load


#server only code
- we can import component to client and server but need some times to import only on server only
so use npm i server-only

#third party packages
slider uses client side feature so it can't be use on server component
we can define it at another ie on components page and import it 

#Context Provider
- live near the root of an application to share global state and logic
- we cant use it on layout it works on client component
- we can make layout client component but it will lead to make all the other component client
- so create a context nd render it and use it by importing it

#Client only code
- use fo client component only
- prevent unintended server side side usage of client side code
